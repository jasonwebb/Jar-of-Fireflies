# Jar of Fireflies

Mason jar outfitted with LEDs and a small microcontroller programmed to mimic the behavior of fireflies caught on a warm summer night. A gentle tap on the glass catches the attention of a piezo element, startling the lights and causing them to rapidly flash for a moment before returning to their blissful natural state.

An external sensor interface enables more complex interactions using both analog and digital sensors for properties like temperature, sound, light, distance/proximity, movement, tilt, biometrics, and much more.

This is a modernized reinvention of the classic ["Jar of fireflies"](http://www.instructables.com/id/Jar-of-Fireflies/) project by Keso using the Arduino framework and the ATTiny85 microcontroller.

## Features
* ATTiny85 microcontroller programmed with Arduino using the [HLT bootloader](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695), mounted in a DIP IC socket for easy removal and replacement.
* Six charlieplexed through-hole LEDs, with the option to use SMD LEDs with fancy soldering.
* Large plated hole pairs for alligator clips so multiple jars can be daisy-chained to a single power source.
* Piezo sensor to detect tapping for interaction.
* Tactile button as an alternative to the piezo sensor for interaction.
* 3-pin interface for external sensors (both analog and digital) to enable more complex interactions.
* 2x3 pin ICSP interface for easier reprogramming.
* Multiple power input options including:
  * 3.5mm center-positive barrel jack for common wall supplies.
  * 2-pin JST-PH jack for battery packs.

This license is chosen mainly in an effort, however naive, to discourage low-quality "knock offs" from flooding the market, which can lead to frustration and lack of trust in consumers caused by poor documentation, support, and quality assurance - a concern that tends to be unique to open-source hardware.

I expressly and strongly approve of use of this project for conference badges/swag, soldering workshops, art projects, and other small-scale community and creative-oriented applications. Such applications are what motivate me to share these source files in the first place!
